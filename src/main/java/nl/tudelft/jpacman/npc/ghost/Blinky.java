/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of the classic Pac-Man ghost Shadow.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Nickname: Blinky. As his name implies, Shadow is usually a constant shadow on
 * Pac-Man's tail. When he's not patrolling the top-right corner of the maze,
 * Shadow tries to find the quickest route to Pac-Man's position. Despite the
 * fact that Pinky's real name is Speedy, Shadow is actually the fastest of the
 * ghosts because of when there are only a few pellets left, Blinky drastically
 * speeds up, which can make him quite deadly. In the original Japanese version,
 * his name is Oikake/Akabei.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>AI:</b> When the ghosts are not patrolling in their home corners (Blinky:
 * top-right, Pinky: top-left, Inky: bottom-right, Clyde: bottom-left), Blinky
 * will attempt to shorten the distance between Pac-Man and himself. If he has
 * to choose between shortening the horizontal or vertical distance, he will
 * choose to shorten whichever is greatest. For example, if Pac-Man is four grid
 * spaces to the left, and seven grid spaces above Blinky, he'll try to move up
 * towards Pac-Man before he moves to the left.
 * </p>
