/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of the classic Pac-Man ghost Pokey.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Nickname: Clyde. Pokey needs a new nickname because out of all the ghosts,
 * Pokey is the least likely to "C'lyde" with Pac-Man. Pokey is always the last
 * ghost out of the regenerator, and the loner of the gang, usually off doing
 * his own thing when not patrolling the bottom-left corner of the maze. His
 * behavior is very random, so while he's not likely to be following you in hot
 * pursuit with the other ghosts, he is a little less predictable, and still a
 * danger. In Japan, his name is Otoboke/Guzuta.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>AI:</b> Pokey has two basic AIs, one for when he's far from Pac-Man, and
 * one for when he is near to Pac-Man. When the ghosts are not patrolling their
 * home corners, and Pokey is far away from Pac-Man (beyond eight grid spaces),
 * Pokey behaves very much like Blinky, trying to move to Pac-Man's exact
 * location. However, when Pokey gets within eight grid spaces of Pac-Man, he
 * automatically changes his behavior and goes to patrol his home corner in the
 * bottom-left section of the maze.
 * </p>
